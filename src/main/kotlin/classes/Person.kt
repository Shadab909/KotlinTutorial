/*
  VISIBILITY MODIFIER
  Four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: private, protected, internal, and public.
  The default visibility is public.

  PUBLIC
  If you donâ€™t use a visibility modifier, public is used by default, which means
  that your declarations will be visible everywhere.

  PRIVATE
  If you mark a declaration as private, it will only be visible inside the file
  that contains the declaration.

  INTERNAL
  If you mark it as internal, it will be visible everywhere in the same module.

  PROTECTED
  The protected modifier is not available for top-level declarations.
